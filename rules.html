                    c) All Allotment holders are members of the SNAA and therefore can enjoy the benefits that the Association has to offer.

                    2. Members.
                    a. Every member is on equal terms with all other members and is expected to assist the Management Committee in the protection and
                    development of the site.
                    b) Members are expected to exercise their rights by attending the Annual General Meeting.
                    c) Members may be called upon to share in the Administration of the Association if required.

                    3. Plots.
                    a) Members are expected to maintain their plots in a good state of cultivation. Weeds and roots etc. should be kept under control and
                    not cause problems to neighbouring plot holders. Rubbish and weeds must be properly disposed of and not be dumped in hedges (See para 12).
                    Carefully dried vegetable and other waste may be burned on site. (See bonfires below). Diseased plants i.e.; potato blight should be 
                    bagged and taken away for disposal.
                    b) Members are responsible for maintaining all paths surrounding and crossing their plots. These shall be approximately 24‚Äù wide, weed
                    free and kept trimmed and edged.
                    c) Members shall not allow any rubbish or refuse to be deposited on his plot from any off-site source apart from manure and compost.
                    d) Members must not cause, permit or suffer any nuisance or annoyance to any other plot holder or neighbouring resident of the site.
                    e) A member may not enter on to any other plot nor must he remove produce from any other active or vacant plot without the express 
                    approval of the plot holder.

                    4. Subletting.
                    Plots which have been allocated may not be sublet, transferred or changed without approval of the Management Committee.

                    5. Livestock. 
                    Under the provision of the Allotment Act 1950 only rabbits and hens may be kept on site with the authority of the Management Committee. 
                    Up to 12 hens are allowed per plot. Cockerels are not permitted. Livestock pens, runs and housing should not exceed 25% of the total area 
                    of the plot, unless pens are also utilised for cultivation. The plot holder should ensure that the livestock pens are secure and kept in a 
                    good state of repair at all times and not allowed to cause a nuisance to other plot holders or neighbouring residential properties. 
                    Any dead livestock must be removed from site and disposed of in the correct way.

                    6. Dogs. 
                    Dogs must be kept on a very short the lead at all times when brought on to the site. Any faeces to be removed off site by the owner.

                    7. Sheds/Greenhouses.
                    Members must seek permission (in writing) from the committee before erecting a shed. A storage shed and one greenhouse per tenancy is 
                    permitted. The individual base dimensions shall not measure more than 72 sq. ft. Sheds and greenhouses shall be kept in a good state of 
                    repair by the plot holder and removed from the site by the member when relinquishing his plot unless the incoming tenant agrees to accept 
                    them. Sheds should not be sited in a position that may cause a nuisance to neighbouring plot holders. Oil and lubricants may be stored in 
                    the main Allotment shed. It is not permitted to store petrol in any building on the site.

                    8. Poly Tunnels.
                    Poly tunnels must not be erected without the prior consent of the Management Committee. Only one tunnel per plot will be allowed the 
                    position of which will be carefully agreed by the Committee. A poly tunnel must not exceed 6m. long x 3m wide. (Only allowed at Filbridge 
                    Rise site).

                    9. Trees. 
                    The Tenancy Agreement states 75% of the plot needs to be cultivated. Fruit trees/hedging can be included in the remaining 25% of
                    non-cultivated area. Due to the limited space available, any tenant wishing to plant fruit trees or perennial bushes must seek 
                    (in writing/email) permission from the Management Committee prior to planting fruit trees/hedges. And the positioning, should not cause
                    undue shade on neighbouring plots. All trees, bushes and hedging over the absolute height of 2.5 metres (or 8 feet) in height are in 
                    breach of allotment rules and will lead to a notice. Tenants must not, without consent of a Council officer, cut or prune trees outside of
                    their own allotment or plant any trees which will exceed an absolute height of 2.5 metres (or 8 feet) and/or allow self-seeded trees to 
                    grow on their allotment, including any that are growing through a perimeter fencing. Tenants who have fruit trees that have grown above 2.5
                    metres will be served a notice instructing them to prune trees to an acceptable height. Where trees are not pruned back to an acceptable 
                    height then the council reserves the right to prune back trees. Forms of trees allowed on the allotment are Espalier, Fan, Cordon, Step 
                    over, bush and Dwarf Bush. All fruit trees must be selected so as to avoid breaching the height rule, with trees being selected to grow to 
                    around 2 metres but no higher than the absolute height of 2.5 metres. Trees should be grown on dwarfing or semi dwarfing rootstocks (m26) and
                    pruned so as not to exceed 2.5 metres in height. The council reserves the right to enter any plot, with or without the consent of the tenant, 
                    to remove oversized trees and plants over 2.5 metres (or 8 feet) in height. Invasive plants such as Bamboo, all types of willow and fast-growing 
                    conifers (including Christmas trees) are not permitted. Trees planted adjacent to the road must be at least 1.5 meters from the road edge. 
                    Branches should not be allowed to cause obstruction on the common pathways, must be maintained in good condition and regularly pruned.

                    10. Irrigation. 
                    An irrigation system serving all parts of the site has been installed. Members are expected to maintain their part of the system in good 
                    condition. Any defects or suspected leaks should be reported to the Site Liaison committee member immediately. Under normal circumstances 
                    water will be regularly pumped into the system from an onsite well. If the well should dry out then a source of mains water will be introduced 
                    into the system. Please remember that water is a scarce and expensive resource that should be carefully used. Water supply into watering cans
                    must always be made via an automatic cut off, (float valve etc). Hosepipes directly feeding on to plots are strictly banned. Members should
                    practice sensible water conservation by using water butts on sheds and consider mulching.

                    11. Non-Cultivation. 
                    All plots will be subject to an inspection in summer of each year to ensure that the plot is being used and cultivated in accordance with 
                    the Tenancy Agreement. The examiner will be an independent and impartial observer who will not be aware of the identity of individual plot 
                    holders. They will report his findings directly to the Town Council who will take the necessary action. In the event that a plot holder is 
                    failing to maintain their plot to a satisfactory standard of cultivation he/she will receive a ‚ÄòNotice of Remedy‚Äô letter in which the 
                    non-compliances are highlighted. The tenant then has 4 weeks in which to remedy the shortcomings. If they fail to act on the notice within 
                    the allowed period and there are no extenuating circumstances why this should not be then the tenant will be issued with an irrevocable 
                    ‚ÄòNotice to Quit‚Äô letter within 1 month from the receipt of the letter. A tenant who receives 3 Notice of Remedy letters over a 3 year period 
                    will, on receipt of the fourth Notice of Remedy will also receive a Notice to Quit letter. A member may appeal the decision of the inspector 
                    only to the Town Council. An example of the examination documentation used by the examiner is attached at Annex A & B to these guidelines.

                    12. Bonfires.
                    Only burn dry material and never burn household rubbish or anything containing plastic, foam or paint. Bonfires should be supervised at all times
                     and extinguished before leaving the site. Bonfires should be controlled so as not to cause discomfort or nuisance to neighbouring residential areas. 
                     (No fires allowed on the Chinnocks site due to the close proximity of houses).

                    13. Waiting list:
                    A waiting list will be maintained by the Management Committee recording applications from Sturminster Newton residents for an allotment. The 
                    general rule is the selection shall be in order of application date, however should an applicant, for acceptable reasons, turn down an 
                    allocation the next person on the list shall be offered the plot. In this case the original applicant will remain on top of the list. In 
                    the first instance applicants will normally be offered a small plot either at Chinnocks or Filbridge Rise. After a period of 12 months they can 
                    then apply to the Secretary to be placed on the Shadow List for a larger plot. Allocation to a larger plot from the shadow list will be made in 
                    application date order. If a person turns down a move they will still retain their position on the list and the plot offered to the next person on 
                    the list. Normally the shadow list requirement will be satisfied first and the remaining plot offered to the waiting list. A plot holder may not 
                    own two separated plots. If a plot holder accepts an alternative plot he must relinquish his existing plot within a reasonable period of time 
                    depending upon the harvesting of his crops and with the agreement of the oncoming tenant. This would normally be 3-6 months. Maintenance of 
                    the waiting and shadow lists will be by the Management Committee to whom all queries must be made in the first instance. Any final appeal 
                    regarding a Management Committee decision will be heard by the Town Council.

                    14. Commercial Activities.
                    It is not permitted to grow crops for commercial purposes. An allotment is specifically intended for producing crops for immediate family
                    needs. It is however permitted to sell on or exchange any surpluses of a particular vegetable or crop that may occur.

                    15. Use of Chemical Pest Controls and Fertilisers.
                    Only commercially available products from garden or horticultural suppliers may be used. When using sprays or fertilisers all reasonable
                    care must be taken to ensure that adjoining crops and wildlife are not affected. The use and storage of chemicals must be in accordance 
                    with current legislation.

                    16. Manure. 
                    The delivery of manure will be arranged on an annual basis by the Management Committee for the benefit of its members. It
                    will be stored in bulk on designated sites on the allotment. The manure is paid for from Association funds and subsequently recovered 
                    from users. This procedure is carried out on a trust basis with the aim of recovering the full outlay. The cost of the manure for the 
                    coming year, based on a standard wheelbarrow load, will be publicised at the previous AGM. Members are requested to pay the Honorary 
                    Treasurer in advance for the manure.

                    17. Machinery.
                    The Association owns a rotavator and lawn mower for use by members on their plots. The items are housed in the allotment shed and are 
                    provided for use by members use on the following basis. Whilst the use of the lawn mower is free, a charge of ¬£5 per half day will be made 
                    in respect of the rotovator.The item must be booked out prior to use by either contacting the Equipment Manager, Mr Cuff, or entering your 
                    details on the form provided for that purpose in the shed.The item must be returned after use with a full fuel tank and correct oil level. 
                    An oil bottle is stored in the shed.

                    18. Allotment Shed. The allotment shed is primarily used for storing the machinery and equipment owned by the Association. Access is by 
                    a secure padlock. A committee member will show you how to obtain access. Please remember to secure the shed after use.
                    Members store their tools in the shed but it must be at their own risk. You are requested to keep the shed tidy and not
                    anything from it that is not your own property without informing a committee member.

                    19. Purchase of Seeds. 
                    The Association has an agreement with Kings Seeds Ltd. in which seeds and other gardening items may be purchased at a reduced price. 
                    Catalogues will be available from the Secretary early in Autumn. All orders and monies should be returned to the Secretary who will 
                    collate and despatch a bulk order from the Association. Orders will be distributed when received from the Company. It is recommended that 
                    full advantage is taken of the offer as savings can be significant, and experience has shown that the quality of the seeds and service are 
                    to a high standard.

                    20. Communal Greenhouse
                    The communal greenhouse is located on Filbridge Rise behind the main shed for all allotmenteer‚Äôs to utilise.
